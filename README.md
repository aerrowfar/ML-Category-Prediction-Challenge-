The project data is from Kickstarter. The goal of this exercise is to be able to classify the project into its main category given its name and basic information such as launch date, deadline and goal amount. The idea is to be able to suggest the main category to the user based on the name of the project. Each project also belongs to a sub-category, but this is chosen after the main category is selected.

The raw data set is composed of 323750 rows and the following columns:

***name***  : the name of the project\
***goal*** : the amount of money claimed for the project\
***sub_category*** : the sub_category of the project. \
***launched*** : date launched\
***deadline*** : deadline for crowdfunding\
***main_category*** : the main category of the project (this is the target).\


The goal of the challenge is to classify each project in its right main_category.


Data cleaning and choosing which features to use are part of the challenge.
